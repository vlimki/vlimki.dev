NOTE: These are just personal notes regarding the topic, nothing of value here necessarily. I just have no better way to store notes than on here. I tend to use my website as a note-taking application.

___

First finish this book and gather a deeper understanding of all the topics. Then just grind exercises from ~~Thomas' Calculus and some precalculus book.~~ this book mainly.

**Notes**
- After you finish reading, start focusing on chemistry and physics. Do math exercises for a couple of hours in the morning though. Start grinding chapters 3 and 4 (and partially 6) at first, then later go to chapter 5.
- Properly study the contents again when doing the exercises, so that you may actually be able to do the harder ones too. Starting with limits
- Do exercises on page 178, 240, 245-248 at some point.

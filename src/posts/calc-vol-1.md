NOTE: These are just personal notes regarding the topic, nothing of value here necessarily. I just have no better way to store notes than on here. I tend to use my website as a note-taking application.

___

First finish this book and gather a deeper understanding of all the topics. Then just grind exercises from Thomas' Calculus and some precalculus book. 

**Notes**
- Finish by October 15
- Read pages 0-535 (currently on page 170).
- Skip pages 297-397 (differential equations, polynomial approximations to functions).
- Do exercises in the morning and read further in the afternoon.

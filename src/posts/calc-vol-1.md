NOTE: These are just personal notes regarding the topic, nothing of value here necessarily. I just have no better way to store notes than on here. I tend to use my website as a note-taking application.

**Notes**
- Have two math blocks during the day. Just do as many chapters as you can in those two blocks.
- Regarding exercises --- the key is to understand the material. Literally, that's it. This does mean that you should understand every theorem and why they're useful, but it does NOT mean that you should be able to complete every exercise. Use your intuition. If you have trouble developing intuition for a theorem, just ask ChatGPT and do some exercises regarding it. Avoid repetition in exercises.

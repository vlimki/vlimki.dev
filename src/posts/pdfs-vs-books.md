There's no way a title like that won't cause controversy, right? How could anyone even consider the absurd idea that some computer screen could replace a book? Well, fear not: from the nature of this post, one should be able to derive that the end conclusion is inevitably going to read along the lines of *"use what works for you"* --- and indeed it is. But you'll never know what works best until you try everything! I thought I could provide some interesting insight as to why I chose one over the other. So, let me give you a bit of a backstory first.

Most of the reading I've done has always been through PDF files on my computer. I've gotten accustomed to the habit from a very young age. Be it whatever interest that happened to pop up into my mind, I would just go on random Reddit threads to see what books people on there would recommend for getting started in said subject. (NOTE: Reddit is actually surprisingly good for that --- but for that only.)

This kind of strategy worked really well. I eventually ended up getting myself a Kindle too. I would organize my reading so that the highly technical books would be read as PDFs on my computer and the less technical books (philosophy, finance, etc.) would be read on my Kindle. Overall, reading digitally was my way to go...

**Until recently.**

A lot of people I interact with have strong opinions about reading digitally --- and I think this kind of holds for most of the population anyway: **people *really* prefer physical books over digital books**, and it's not even close.

Why could that be? The most frequent answers I've seen are the following:
1. It feels better.
2. It's less straining for your eyes (valid concern).
3. It's more relaxing.

Intrigued by these claims, I open-mindedly started buying physical books. I had to see what the fuss was all about. I only did this for math books since I was already very satisfied with the performance of e-readers; e-ink screens really don't suffer from the disadvantages listed above.

Well, I ended up regretting my purchases later. It's not like it was an absolutely detrimental decision or anything, I was just a little disappointed.

I do have to note that my experiences are based strictly on reading mathematics though --- perhaps the results would've differed had my reading needs been different.

## What Went Wrong?

Initially I was quite excited --- the feeling of just getting your hands on an item that contains so much knowledge is exciting. Certainly, the learning opportunity was becoming concrete. I read quite a bit of the books I had bought until I realized that something just didn't feel quite right. Were the aforementioned flaws of digital reading resolved? Well, yes, but not really. And I'll now go over why I think that is the case.

### 1. "It feels better"

This is quite a vague statement anyways, but I'll try to make the best of it. The main problem I saw in terms of "comfort" or "feeling good" was the fact that one's posture when reading is not terribly good. You really have to lean forwards a lot to read the text on the paper.

Well, why not just use a book holder? I tried to! My MASSIVE (4.7kg) calculus book just happened to be way too big for it. Arguably my problem can be resolved by just getting a better book holder. But even if I did, it's not really more comfortable assuming you take notes on your laptop (which I'll elaborate more on later).

### 2. "It's less straining for your eyes"

This is probably the best point out of them all. This doesn't really impact me personally but I know eye strain is quite detrimental to a large majority of people. I find that your eyes will be just fine assuming you had a good night's sleep and you spent some time outside.

### 3. "It's more relaxing"

It sure is. This does not really work for studying mathematics though. You don't want to be in a state of relaxation when studying mathematics --- you want to be alert. Again, this is very specialized and I think it can be either a positive or a negative effect depending on the context. Obviously physical books or e-readers are the clear winner when you're trying to read something before going to bed, no question about that.

However, these alone aren't really an enough of a reason for me to completely ditch physical books:

## Are There Advantages to Using PDFs?

Sure! It's mostly workflow-related; it really is much simpler to process the things of the book and put them in a useful format (notes, blog post) when everything is on one screen. I take notes with $\LaTeX$, and it's just such a well-oiled machine to have your notes in a window right next to the book.

Like, okay, remove everything but your laptop from your desk, set up `dwm` with one workspace only, create one window for a PDF reader with your book and another one for your notes, and tell me that is not the most productive workflow you've ever seen.

Really, the minimalism advantages you get are quite something as well. All you need is a laptop and possibly some pen and paper for doing assignments. And obviously using PDFs is more portable as you can read your books anywhere you go as long as you have your laptop with you. It's also much more convenient to take a screenshot of the PDF to feed it to an LLM than it is to manually type things out.

One more thing is that you don't really have to worry about bad print quality (which is unfortunately not an uncommon phenomenon) or not getting a softcover book to stay on the right page. PDFs are usually cheaper as well.

## Conclusion

Overall, I find that it can be quite a hassle to take math notes with a physical book. Hence I moved back to my PDF files for technical books.

Well, the inevitable conclusion is to use whatever works best for you. Not much I can add to that.

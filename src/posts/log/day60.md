Time blocking has definitely helped me a lot. Getting so much stuff done now.

**Tasks**
- [x] (Math) Get to integrals in Calculus book.
- [x] (Math) Use other resources for learning about binomial coefficients, prove the binomial theorem by induction and maybe do a couple of exercises regarding it.
- [x] (ML) Read at least 20 pages of The 100-Page Machine Learning Book.
- [x] (ML) Start learning PyTorch, figure out what project to do with it (maybe just MNIST).
- [ ] ~~(ML) Finish backprop section of Haskell MNIST post.~~ Got quite far only to figure out my implementation was incorrect :D

**Time spent**: 7.5h<br /> **Total**: 176.5h/10000h

I find that it's terribly easy to slack off during sessions as long as there is relatively easy access to some form of stimulation. And it's a bit of a domino effect, once you start slacking off once, everything else starts falling apart as well. Quite a good day regardless. Wasted some time but it's whatever

**Tasks**
- [x] (Math) Read integrals for step functions, exercises 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
- [x] (Math) If you have time left, read the next chapter about integrals for general functions.
- [x] (ML) Keep working on autograd engine. Implement current TODO list + add gradients for relu/tanh/sigmoid.
- [x] (ML) Read a particular article about tensors.
- [ ] (ML) Study CNNs and understand roughly how they work.
- [ ] (ML) With the rest of the time left, learn PyTorch. And figure out a practical way to actually learn it.

**Time spent**: 3h<br /> **Total**: 179.5h/10000h

Hope the cold will be better today. Will be doing the physics stuff regardless since it's light work.

**Tasks**
- [x] Good work on Zig chess engine.
- [x] Look a bit into what HS final exams on physics are like, and what you'll have to study. Also think about potential physics books to read.
- [ ] (Math) Page 69 exercise 14.
- [ ] (ML) Backprop function for autograd engine (not necessarily for today, just here so that I remember).

- [ ] (In the future) Write a "Day X of ML" style blog post about CNNs.

**Time spent**: 3.5h<br /> **Total**: 190.5h/10000h

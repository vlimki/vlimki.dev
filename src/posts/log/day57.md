Things are definitely going a bit slowly rn, need to accelerate and get back on track. A feeling of the scarcity of time is becoming less present, which of course is a bad thing. Perhaps time blocking could help a bit with that.

**Tasks**
- [x] Update website (mainly log page)
- [ ] Look into time blocking, or maybe develop your own solution.

**Time spent**: 2h<br /> **Total**: 163h/10000h

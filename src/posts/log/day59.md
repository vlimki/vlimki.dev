I'm thinking that I might have to rebrand this "Day X of ML" thing to make it fit better on my website.

**Tasks**
- [x] At most 10 minutes of using X, no social media usage besides that.
- [x] Get moving forward with math in the morning.
- [x] (ML Block) Spend time thinking about the next move for ML. Probably learning PyTorch first, and then moving over to HaskTorch.
- [x] (ML Block) Look further into Kaggle competitions.


**Time spent**: 5h<br /> **Total**: 169h/10000h

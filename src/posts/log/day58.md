A good philosophy to apply to time blocking is to not have specific tasks for each block, but to instead just figure out what you'll be doing dynamically to move forward with the project. And think of days and time blocks in terms of percentages, not hours and minutes.

Really gotta limit social media usage. Just have to remember that doing nothing is inherently positive, considering the circumstances

**Tasks**
- [x] Figure out a good time blocking system (might have to develop one yourself)

**Time spent**: 1h<br /> **Total**: 164h/10000h

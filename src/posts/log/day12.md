    import Image from '$lib/components/Image.svelte';
</script>

**Time spent**: 0h<br /> **Total**: 0h/10000h

Wasn't home for most of the day, and won't be for the next couple of days. I don't have access to my math books so I'm gonna have to look into some code-related stuff. Probably gonna learn PyTorch.

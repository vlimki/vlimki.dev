Again some slacking off but got a decent amount of work done. Just have to realize that slacking off is a rabbit hole, so you should restrain yourself from any laziness whatsoever. Just read or play chess when you need to do something more chill.

It's time to write a chess engine in Zig. It's probably a perfect mix of machine learning and low-level software engineering.

**Tasks**
- [x] (Math) Continue reading on integrals and do every exercise in the chapter (1-28). It's good practice.
- [x] (Math) Read the proofs of the next chapter.
- [x] (Math) See if there are any interesting exercises in previous chapters (mainly p. 67-69). Assign them for tomorrow.
- [x] (ML) Study CNNs and understand roughly how they work.
- [x] (ML) Figure out good ML projects. Chess engine????
- [x] Ziglings first 25 exercises

**Time spent**: 5h<br /> **Total**: 184.5h/10000h

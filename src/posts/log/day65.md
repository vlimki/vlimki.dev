Cold was getting worse, did some light Zig work but otherwise it was just an unproductive day.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Look a bit into what physics exams are like, what you'll have to study and potential books.
- [ ] (Math) Page 69 exercise 14.
- [ ] (ML) Backprop function for autograd engine (not necessarily for today, just here so that I remember).


**Time spent**: 0.5h<br /> **Total**: 187h/10000h

Only pawns left for chess engine move generation.

Still need to get back on track with time blocking and routine stuff. Won't be home for the next two days but
I really need to get back into the routines after that.

**Tasks**
- [x] Finish move generation for most of the pieces in the chess engine.
- [ ] (Math) Page 69 exercise 14.
- [ ] (Math) Page 117, at least half of exercises 1-14.

- [ ] (In the future) Backprop function for autograd engine (not necessarily for today, just here so that I remember).
- [ ] (In the future) Write a "Day X of ML" style blog post about CNNs.

**Time spent**: 2h<br /> **Total**: 195h/10000h

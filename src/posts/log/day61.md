First day of school. Still managed to fit 5 hours of work into the day. Some slacking off in the ML block, I think the goals I set were too easy and not specific enough.

Started writing an autograd engine in Haskell.

**Tasks**
- [x] (Math) Do Exercise 6 regarding area proofs.
- [x] (Math) Step functions, exercises 4 and 5.
- [ ] (Math) Read through integrals chapter (possibly do exercises if there's time).
- [x] (ML) Learn about tensors.
- [ ] (ML) Learn more PyTorch.
- [x] (ML) Figure out practical ML projects to do. (Could be Kaggle competitions too)

**Time spent**: 5h<br /> **Total**: 176.5h/10000h

Basically recovered from the cold now. Can't use it as a reason for not getting stuff done anymore. Anyway, it was a decently productive day.

**Tasks**
- [x] Further work on chess engine, maybe start building a graphical interface for it? (web or local gui? or BOTH?)
- [ ] (Math) Page 69 exercise 14.
- [ ] (ML) Backprop function for autograd engine (not necessarily for today, just here so that I remember).
- [ ] (In the future) Write a "Day X of ML" style blog post about CNNs.

**Time spent**: 2.5h<br /> **Total**: 193h/10000h

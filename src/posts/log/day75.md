Need to think more about what ML subfield to pick. Robotics seems very interesting but it's definitely a bit out of my reach right now. It's very hard to get better at ML without having exciting projects to build.

**Tasks**
- [x] Get going with math again.
- [ ] (Chess engine) (In the future) Connect UI with engine. How? Wasm? An API?

**Time spent**: 2h<br /> **Total**: 200h/10000h

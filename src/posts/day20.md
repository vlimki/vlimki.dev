I have personal beef with Python. It feels powerless. It's slow, unsafe and clumsy. Fortunately, you only really need working knowledge of it for ML. Since my projects aren't necessarily going to production, I might as well start writing all my code in Haskell. After I've gotten some more linear algebra down, I'll be writing a neural net using Haskell.

I'll also be majoring in mathematics so there's no harm in learning a bit of functional programming.
